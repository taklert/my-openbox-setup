# my-openbox-setup

Hi! This repository will contains my openbox setup in the near future.
ATM I learn to use github from the command line, but, as soon as I figure out my needings from github, I'll upload my config files. This rc.xml, and menu.xml file, what U can see here, is a sample alike thing. Use it for your own risk!
